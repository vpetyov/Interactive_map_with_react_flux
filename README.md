When Country is selected in the Drop-down - the Cities in this countries will be listed in text area 6. A new City can be added to selected Country by typing a name and pressing button "Add City" 7. If no Country is selected, there should be shown a Popup with Error message.  * The design itself is not a critical - some standard CSS or CSS library is OK (or use of Material design styles) ** Using ReactJS for the Views will be considered as Extra *** Using Flux architecture for data flow will be considered as Extra
